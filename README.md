# Sameer's Resume

## Description

This is a repository that contains an ❄️Minimalistic Resume : Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, & JS. I built this project to showcase my skills and experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This project solves the problem of having a boring and plain resume that does not stand out. I learned how to use Tailwind components and utilities to create a responsive and attractive resume. This project stands out because it is interactive and easy to navigate.
