# Sameer's Resume

## Description

This is a repository that contains my resume as a web developer. I built this project to showcase my skills and experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. This project solves the problem of having a boring and plain resume that does not stand out. I learned how to use Tailwind components and utilities to create a responsive and attractive resume. This project stands out because it is interactive and easy to navigate.
